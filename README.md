# Sports Celebrity Image Classification
This project involves applying machine learning algorithms to classify images of sports celebrities. Given an image, the model predicts the name of the celebrity by analyzing visual features from the picture. The project includes steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve high classification accuracy. A FastAPI server is used to serve the model for real-time image predictions.

# Bangalore Property Price Prediction (Regression)
In this regression-based project, the aim is to predict property prices in Bangalore based on features such as the number of bedrooms, area, bathrooms, and location. The machine learning pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy. A FastAPI server is integrated to provide a web interface for property price predictions.

# Importance of Regression and Classification in Machine Learning
Both regression and classification are fundamental tasks in machine learning with broad applications. Regression is used to predict continuous values, such as housing or stock prices, and is highly valuable in industries like real estate and finance. Classification, on the other hand, categorizes data into distinct groups, such as identifying celebrities in images, and plays a crucial role in fields like computer vision and social media analysis. These two projects demonstrate the versatility of machine learning in addressing real-world problems.
